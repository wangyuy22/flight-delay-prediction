# U.S. Flight Delay Prediction Model

For anyone who has traveled on an airplane, you may have experience with one of the inevitable pains of flying: the delays. Sometimes your plane arrives late, other times there may be a queue for takeoff, occasionally the weather forces hour-long delays (or even cancellation); regardless of the reason for the delay, they pose a huge inconvenience for travelers.
Hence, given the vast amount of data on flight travels (16+ million flights annually in the U.S. alone), valuable insights can be drawn from this data to allow us to gain a better understanding of flight delays. Moreover, with the abundance in data, machine learning models can be trained to possibly predict these delays â€” something that may prove very valuable in for individual travelers and businesses alike. Thus, this is a topic that I hope to explore further by extracting potentially meaningful insights from available data and constructing and comparing machine learning models to hopefully predict flight delays.
